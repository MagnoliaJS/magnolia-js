                <h2>About MagnoliaJS</h2>
                <p>
                    MagnoliaJS is a community-driven software development
                    conference for web developers in Jackson, Mississippi. Our
                    mission is to foster a vibrant and inclusive community of
                    tech enthusiasts, and to showcase the growing and thriving
                    developer talent in the heart of the Hospitality State. Now
                    in its fifth year, we are building on the success from
                    previous years and continuing to work to bring developers
                    from around the nation to Jackson, MS to showcase the city,
                    state, and community we are building here in Mississippi.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We started in 2019 as a one-day event with 150 attendees and
                    12 speakers. Since then, we have grown to a two-day event
                    with over 300 attendees and 24 speakers from all over the
                    country. We are proud to be the first and only developer
                    conference in Mississippi, and one of the few in the region.
                    Our conference features a diverse lineup of speakers,
                    covering topics such as React, Vue, Angular, Node, GraphQL,
                    TypeScript, Serverless, Accessibility, Performance, Testing,
                    and more.

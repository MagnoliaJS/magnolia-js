            The Mississippi Museum of Art is more than an art museum in Jackson, Mississippi. It is
            a museum of Mississippiâ€”a museum that connects Mississippians to our culture, our
            history, our communities, and to each other. It is a museum informed by the legacy of
            our past and emboldened by a vision of a future without division.

          We're excited to host MagnoliaJS 2022 at the Mississippi Museum of Art in their beautiful
          event space. Attendees will also have the ability to enjoy the museum's collection of
          Mississippi art during the event.
